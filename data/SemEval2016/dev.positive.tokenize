Rumor has it that Sting will appear on #RAW tomorrow night .
@Danielmmafan Sting could always have another match before . I just read hes gonna be on Raw tomorrow .
Sting will be on RAW tomorrow though so that should set up the taker/Sting match

That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while , finishing off with Sting ! Could we see #RollinsvsSting
Including his TNA title wins , Sting is a 14-time World Champion . Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time . @wwe #raw
great RAW tonight ... 1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting !!! #WWERaw #WWE
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
Sting is back , and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole . Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work , Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try & plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ !!

And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is . #RAW
He may be 56 , but Sting is still as passionate as ever and still has the fire . Still awesome on the mic . He and Rollins will be M-O-N-E-Y .
Going on record , Sting wins belt at NoC , drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd . If I'm wrong , ya can have open season on me .
