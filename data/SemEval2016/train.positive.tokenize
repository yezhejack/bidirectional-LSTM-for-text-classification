@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce . Hence " Supreme Court . "
@chrisbraly SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it . 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans

Dierks Bentley and Eric Church at @countryconcert ! Happy 22nd birthday to me ! Is it July yet ?
Murray has given it his all , which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable . TB 2nd set . #CincyTennis
Federer stays winning . Into the finals tomorrow .
Federer beats Murray 6-4 , 7-6(6 ) to reach #CincyTennis final . He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic , who is going for his first
Way to go Roger . Old man Federer just keeps rolling along . #Djokernole v . #Fed for the final tomorrow . #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow . Fancy the Swiss , can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one .
Federer will play another final tomorrow . This guy is just amazing . #CincyTennis
Excited for the Federer vs . Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon . Should be some great tennis !
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets . Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals . Decent trio .
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve . Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal !
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak . The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them .
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set ! Even consolidates the break ! Up 3-0 ! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis
Federer's a man with a mission ... 7th one coming .. #CincyTennis
Tiger , Federer , Serena , the Niners ( eesh about those guys ) , and some cold TX brews . laaazzzy birthday Sunday .
For the 1st time , Federer has beaten No . 1 and No . 2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title . #CincyTennis
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe .
What a great day for world sport : Usain got his 9th gold , Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights . #truepro
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow , reviewing Federer , Serena and the pre US Open storylines . This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8
Add to the results , Federer over Djokovic and Lewis Hamilton , and it's not a bad Sunday at all !
23rd of August was such a nice day , England lift Ashes , Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati .
" Papa you need a hat " thus said one of Federer's twin girls ....... congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era . 15th straight year . Connors leads with 18 .
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though . But 3 sets may be a critical variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic !
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time .

@oreillyfactor @realDonaldTrump @ThePeople4Trump @mikecahall1 the U.S. Open is rockin .. Nadal tonite , Federer tomorrow
How to watch Federer and Murray on Tuesday at the 2015 US Open : Roger Federer will begin his 2015 US Open on T ... http://t.co/GlxQkdiJZN
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1 . His draw is tricky . So is Murray's . If Fed reaches the QFs , then he may meet Berdy .
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow !
Yes , Federer's attacking return is brilliant . But yes , it's a play club players can do too , esp . off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss .
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round . Go watch it .
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve . Well , one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading .
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs . Tomic match takes !
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match & the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match ! Woah !
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
Last year , majority of the Federer matches took place primetime . This year , it's the other way around . 2nd on Ashe tomorrow
@SJauhar I keep trying to book as soon as I learn when Federer's playing - too late . Nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250 .
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up & the big names of Serena , Venus , Djokovic , Murray , Federer & Wawrinka are still in the draw .
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw , Nadal , Federer and Djokovic included . Make no mistake ,
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others ( no points for guessing ) Federer and Djokovic .
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve !! Federer is on red hot form & doesnt look like stopping . Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur . Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set !
Wow , tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just like in the 2nd , Federer breaks back .
Roger while having trouble with serve , he is still through to 4th round ! Federer might face Isner in 4th round
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach . Its you ! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer !
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen
Federer advances into fourth round at US Open : In the blazing New York sun , Federer seems to be in his element ... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep ...! Yep , Murray and Federer into the top 16 . Phew ! :) See you tomorrow !
Monday at the US Open : Murray , Federer & Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of
Federer's second serve placement is awesome . That's why he's the best server ever . Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match ... This thing is good . Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set . #USOpen2015
Federer saved 4 BP ( from 0/40 ) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set .
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots .
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6 . Leads Isner . 7-6(0 ) 7-6(6 ) #usopen
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday , and it was amazing . I still thought " you're not sick of this dude yet ? "
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match . This might be the 2nd . #USOpen2015
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer , he really is the original son of Jor-el
Wow , Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves . Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
Federer's 1st serve is just ... perfect . #USOpen
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve ... Lol wow

We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
I'm crying ! :O Thank you @NBCHannibal for giving Hannibal a home for 3 years , and doing your best to keep it there https://t.co/QJCCTlhNFS

@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try , it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale . ( This movie rules . Loving Maddin Monday )
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal . I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last .
OK so maybe I'm watching , for the 1st time , the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS
@LowriBearman Thank you my love ! And I have had a fab day ! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow ! xx

@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall , Harper and Kershaw better .
@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers . Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate , but , again , he didn't pitch the 7th .
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance , most seats won get 2nd chance . Easy . Harper does not play well with others , ask Danny Williams .
@ian_wayne @P_Wog Keep focus on Harper & all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians

1 gud thing about losing my phone is that it made me use my iPod which has all the songs I used listen to in 3rd year

#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems ! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives !
Sitting at a curb staring at the White House Listening to jay-z . thats a fine Friday
For those who may not know , Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting .
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo
Was hoping this would escalate to be something like Nas vs Jay-Z but Meek got KO'ed in the 2nd round lol

Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd & 3rd time you hear it . You will understand it and Fall in love with it
I was in like the 4th , 5th , 6th grade burning CDs and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of Dipset , old Bone Thugs , and hella Jay-Z
Jay-z may not be the best looking guy , but he proves to others that looks aren't everything
Roadblock : In the immortal words of Jay-Z : " Whatever deity may guide my life , dear lord don't let me die tonight .... http://t.co/mnDysX2NKb

the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye .
Aye now Meek may surprise us . You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas . And then Ether ......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z
#WEHO : @ChrisPipkinSC is leading the pack for a THE CARTERS : Lil Wayne , Beyonce , and Jay-Z ride Thursday at 5:30 pm ! Grab a bike !

Talib , Jay-Z , Kanye , T.I , Big Pooh , Dela , J Dilla , Nas , Pete Rock , 9th Wonder and the legendary Slum Village .
Personally handing Jay-Z jerseys may be the highlight of my New York existence . First time I've been star struck .
From now on I'll try to be more sympathetic towards Freemasons like Jay-Z . When you come from nothing European culture may look like heaven .
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding . Imma let Taylor finish , but she had the best birthday of all time .

" We make a million of beats , cause our stories is deep . And fuck tomorrow , as long as the night before was sweet . " - Jay-Z
Only looking forward to Kanye's performance at the VMA's tomorrow ! Heard he's bringing out Rih , Bey , Jay-z & Paul McCarthy
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville . I may have dropped a tear or two . Greatest show ever !
If Kanye became President , folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless , may think again !
Today during 6th it was dead silent in the library & all of a sudden my iPad started blasting Jay-Z's voice saying " Motherfucker I got this "
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem , Jay-Z , 2Pac , The Notorious B.I.G. , and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Jay-Z sat in that Interview like a God showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with Foxy Brown

I may not seem like the target demographic but let me tell u that I think Magic Mike XXL is one of the most excellent pieces of film making
Magic Mike XXL is better than the 1st . I learned a lot about the male stripper psyche & culture (& midlife crisis ) , & female sexual desire .
Yes , Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie , but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
A FB friend of mine just posted that seeing Magic Mike XXL was the best night of her life . If only she knew what my typical sat night is .
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL ? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again .
Also , ace time with the uni ladies . Saturday in Stonehaven , barbeque , Magic Mike XXL , tons of food ... hips hurt from all the walking though !
I want Magic Mike XXL !! C'mon ? ;) #hoorayformonday #workwork #nachos #lavinia #novaturient
