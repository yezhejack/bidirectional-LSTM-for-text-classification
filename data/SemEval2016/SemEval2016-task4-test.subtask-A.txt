10605	UNKNOWN	@This_JustIn31 Aaron Samuels asked Cady Heron in math class what day it was. And Cady responded with October 3rd :D
10606	UNKNOWN	I may not like the Seahawks as a team, but Russell Wilson is the real deal when it comes to role models.
10607	UNKNOWN	When I was a kid, my dad and I would go to Kauffman Stadium every Saturday to watch the Royals. Even when they were away. #Royals

10665	UNKNOWN	@rezaaslan @ggreenwald @dan_verg_ Sam Harris isn't liberal. He may think he is, but that's the same as Bill Maher thinking he's funny.
10666	UNKNOWN	If he is becoming a legitimate offensive threat which it appears he is (I know its only preseason) he may be THE x-factor to a Bulls title
10667	UNKNOWN	For the 2nd straight week, the Worst Start of the Week goes to @C_Con26 after starting Russell Wilson (10 pts) over Phillip Rivers (25 pts)
10668	UNKNOWN	@TylerPoslosky Kershaw was mowing them down in the sixth in Game 4, and got shelled in the 7th. Have to be able to count on your bullpen.

13783	UNKNOWN	Hulk Hogan hates black people??? Stop sitting out in the sun to look like me# makeupyourmind
13784	UNKNOWN	With all of the Hulk Hogan controversy I hope Monday Night Raw is redeeming tonight!

13794	UNKNOWN	I can't say that Rollins is the best WWE champ of all time....but he may rank above Hulk Hogan. Brother Brother Brother Brother #Raw
13795	UNKNOWN	I hope Hulk Hogan is the 3rd member
13796	UNKNOWN	John Kasich says the Reagan people talk of is a caricature and Reagan was moderate. Kasich may be a cartoon but Reagan is no caricature
13797	UNKNOWN	Ambrose vs. Big Show? You people are wasting Dean Ambrose. Just when Monday gets good, Big Show &amp; Taker, make me change the channel. #RAW
13798	UNKNOWN	@luvsgingers especially considering some questions may revolve around the whole Hulk Hogan debacle
13799	UNKNOWN	For the 1st time ever.... Noone cares about a @WWETheBigShow match...  Dean Ambrose is the most underutilized star right now! #RAW @WWE
13800	UNKNOWN	July 27th 2015- the day all the women who find Dean Ambrose attractive died

13809	UNKNOWN	If I can finish this final tonight, I'll be able to finally see Ant-Man tomorrow after work.
13810	UNKNOWN	If wwe need a 3rd member of the wyatts so that sting can join Ambrose and reigns Chris Benoit or hulk Hogan could always join them

17481	UNKNOWN	Apparently Paper Towns is out tomorrow, in case you didn't quite get the memo..
17482	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is about to get that 'Tony Romo in the 4th quarter' treatment.
17483	UNKNOWN	Looks like Dustin Johnson won't be winning the pga championship after shooting an 8 on the 1st hole. #choke#PGAChampionship
17484	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson has blew it. Quadruple bogie at the 1st

17547	UNKNOWN	Not often when you see Dustin Johnson going low on a Sunday
17548	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13. He may not have a major, but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song. #USPGA
17549	UNKNOWN	What a joke of a scorecard by Dustin Johnson. -4 today with a quadruple bogey 8 on the par 4 1st.  2 eagles on the back 9. #PGAChampionship
17550	UNKNOWN	If Dustin Johnson had pared the 1st hole he'd be 17 under right now
17551	UNKNOWN	If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch
17552	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson's scorecard is ridiculous. Starts with a snowman on the 1st hole. Since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
17553	UNKNOWN	Brawler Martin Maulers came all the way from Prince George to get #lockedin for their 20th anniversary. Can they get out before their 21st?!

17558	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes.  Oh for that quad on the 1st....

17561	UNKNOWN	I have no idea what to wear tomorrow to the Sam smith concert.. Need to go shopping but hate shopping. Ugh
17562	UNKNOWN	Why is Muhammad a myth.? If not then Muslims should welcome historians to do their job. I say they are afraid of what the historian may find
17563	UNKNOWN	Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
17564	UNKNOWN	Dear @paddypower any chance you can pay out 7th place on dustin johnson after his comeback today #justiceforjohnsonbackers

25165	UNKNOWN	Murray with another huge 1st down run, 26 yds
25166	UNKNOWN	and the reason why they went with Murray, he went 26 yards on that run. Faked half the Sun Devils out of their jocks.
25167	UNKNOWN	#Aggies punter Kaser chopped down hard. Murray gets the ball back after penalty. 1st-and-10 at ASU's 28.
25168	UNKNOWN	Welp. White Sox dominating the #Royals. May be time to go back to the full strength lineup tomorrow.
25169	UNKNOWN	And ASU tackles Murray short of the 1st down for the first time
25170	UNKNOWN	A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
25171	UNKNOWN	@HibernianRetro @Fritz1875 The mic batteries are running out! Murray 3-1 up 2nd set with a break. Matchsticks needed for my eyes here!
25172	UNKNOWN	Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.
25173	UNKNOWN	Could the #Aggies get more conservative on offense? Would be hard. Turn it over on 4th-and-1 at ASU's 20, misusing Murray for second time.
25174	UNKNOWN	Don't forget to ask about your chance to go see Janet Jackson in Saskatoon on Monday. We've got tickets and they could be yours tonight!

25182	UNKNOWN	Liams new tattoo is the number 25, do you know when Zayn left? March 25th so that must mean...  Ziam is real.
25183	UNKNOWN	Murray 6-3 6-2. First set 50mins, 2nd 34. Bellucci's fine start, belief, fading fast, Murray steady with flashes of his best, like SP pass.
25184	UNKNOWN	Everywhere I go by Janet Jackson ! ugh I remember waking up when it was still dark in the winter for school I think like 3rd grade

26205	UNKNOWN	@PegidaUKGroup  As a new Catholic to #LatinMass Prayin for all British Patriots, that they understand the Church was the 1st to fight Islam.

26207	UNKNOWN	I'm being told that tonight is Monday Night Raw at the house at 8 p.m. Here's to hoping John Cena makes an appearance.
26208	UNKNOWN	@kevinanderson18 plays terrific TB &amp; wins it with big off fh winner 7-5. Murray with plenty of work to do now as sun goes down.
26209	UNKNOWN	Anybody know the timings for Foo Fighters tomorrow? When do the supports come on?
26210	UNKNOWN	Murray loses the 1st point. Anderson playing courageous tennis from the baseline. 27 Winners to Murray's 12 #USOpen Can he keep it up ??
26211	UNKNOWN	Just got a large iced coffee from Dunkin, which is my 6th cup of coffee (so far) today. Do you think that's bad?
26212	UNKNOWN	3 unforced errors for Andy Murray against 17 forAnderson yet Murray chucks away the 1st set with a careless double fault in the tie break.
26213	UNKNOWN	you dont understand how excited i am for the foo fighters tomorrow!!   mother fuckin @foofighters   #foofighters   *whispers*  foo fighters
26214	UNKNOWN	Broadcasting tonight at 7:30/8 pm edt. More MGS V: The Phantom Pain (PS4) ... tomorrow will be Destiny! (PS4) #heroofgaming
26215	UNKNOWN	This Red Sox team, this one, start over in May they win the pennant and good chance at WORLD SERIES ..........GO SOX
26216	UNKNOWN	I'm afraid of Murray though... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round. Kevin's strong point is his serves!
26217	UNKNOWN	Murray is so flat atm, if Anderson can get inspired at the start of the 2nd he can take control of this match.
26218	UNKNOWN	Rare i walk away from a match but big day tomorrow so i need my sleep. Shout loud Murray fans #BacktheBrits #USOpen
26219	UNKNOWN	"Gay marriage isn't the law." Yes, it is. It was interpreted by the SCOTUS as such in accordance with rights granted by the 14th Amendment.
26220	UNKNOWN	Anderson now has the confidence to take rips at the Murray 2nd serve. Time to take off a few mph and up the first serve percentage Andrew

26226	UNKNOWN	Not the easiest of shots, but Murray may end up really regretting hitting it long to fall down 0-2 in the 2nd set.
26227	UNKNOWN	Absolutely mortified and gutted that Sam Smith may be doing the new Bond song :(
26228	UNKNOWN	Haha I'm going to see Foo Fighters tomorrow Jesus Christ that's just hit me
26229	UNKNOWN	It may just be me focusing on the losses, but Murray's tie-break record seems shite in my head, in big games at least.
26230	UNKNOWN	Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen
26231	UNKNOWN	Not the best start to the 2nd set from Murray, but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players "look scruffy"
26232	UNKNOWN	Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. I'm not watching any more. He does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!
26233	UNKNOWN	Murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying Murray at Evens? Ridiculous
26234	UNKNOWN	@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
26235	UNKNOWN	1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd. This is beautiful from Kevin
26236	UNKNOWN	@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
26237	UNKNOWN	Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
26238	UNKNOWN	ANDERSON versus MURRAY:  Anderson 1 set ahead, now 2nd set. 3games ahead. 76 31 Murray just kept his game.
26239	UNKNOWN	Looks like Murray is gonna have to do it the hard way again! 1 set down, 3-1 in the 2nd set! #ustennisopen
26240	UNKNOWN	@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray
26241	UNKNOWN	@ChiKidChris17 picking  MVP in July is stupid ..wow were you marking off the days on your I luv Kris Bryant calendar to retweet this ? lol
26242	UNKNOWN	I will wait for the weigh in. Rousey changed her body too much and may have too many things on her plate. I'll know my bet after weigh in
26243	UNKNOWN	Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
26244	UNKNOWN	Anderson's 1st serve goes off in that game but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson now leads 4-1 in the 2nd set #USOpen
26245	UNKNOWN	I counted five tight points from Anderson in that game, may have been more. Gets a slice of fortune with Murray netting the BH. Holds for 41
26246	UNKNOWN	@Michael_Fabiano Help! Should I trade Gore for Murray? I have Gore (I drafted him 4th round) but was offered Murray (went in the 1st round).
26247	UNKNOWN	Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
26248	UNKNOWN	Super super super excited about gay pride on the 19th too mf hype.
26249	UNKNOWN	If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
26250	UNKNOWN	Niall's always thought the warmth of Liam's smile would make the sun feel cold and lifeless. [tries to smile through the tears]
26251	UNKNOWN	Murray now down a set a 2 breaks in the 2nd set: Anderson up 6-4, 5-1 #USOpen2015

26260	UNKNOWN	murray break back anderson wud be stupid sha 2 allow a double break I expect it 2 get 2 5-3 and he serves out the 2nd set leaving it at 6-3
26261	UNKNOWN	Murray get his 1st break of the match to stay in this 2nd set 2-5. Can the No.3 seed continue to turn things around? #USOpen #ESPNTennis
26262	UNKNOWN	Idk if this is or not but shoutout the lil bro Lani for scoring the first TD last Friday night (sing Katy Perry... http://t.co/5XJC8oEAgM
26263	UNKNOWN	Of the 2 Milton Keynes setlists the Foo Fighters played this past weekend, the Saturday was definitely the better one. Glad I was there
26264	UNKNOWN	A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
26265	UNKNOWN	@notzeev IKR, gonna be me tomorrow night "Hi Costco, Naruto ready for work, believe it!"
26266	UNKNOWN	Murray down a set and losing 5-2 in the 2nd set to the 6'8 Anderson. Hard to beat the big hitters when they're serving at their best.
26267	UNKNOWN	Murray holds to 30 and now Anderson leads 5-3 in the 2nd set. Anderson will serve for the set for a 2nd time #USOpen
26268	UNKNOWN	Last two service games started well only to be whittled away at. Still, Murray wins second game on the trot to make it 3-5 in 2nd set.

26274	UNKNOWN	Now I'm done with Ant-Man, which would have been excellent if they kept Wright on, but is at least a lot of fun.  More tomorrow.
26275	UNKNOWN	@harimehato @SAVAGE_KREATOR @jennah_rowell i know niggas that hit licks on Thursday then go home to catch the new episode of Naruto
26276	UNKNOWN	Finally, on the 5th attempt, Anderson wins the second set 6-3, serving his 12th ace for the match to lead 2 sets to love against Murray.
26277	UNKNOWN	Microphone picking up Murray's F bomb at the sit down after the 2nd set...
26278	UNKNOWN	4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!
26279	UNKNOWN	Camera closes in on Murray in his chair after losing 2nd set and he's dropping F bombs like they're going out of fashion. Brilliant. #USOpen
26280	UNKNOWN	I'm sure Murray will win the 3rd set but not sure if he would win the match.
26281	UNKNOWN	Murray two sets to love down. Think the broadcaster may want to turn the volume down, quiet a few F's coming from Murray! #USOpen2015
26282	UNKNOWN	What an effort from Murray in that 2nd set. Got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd. #USOpen
26283	UNKNOWN	Murray needs to send for Thunderbird One here.  Two sets down for the 2nd time.  Surely he can't do it again, can he?  #usopen2015 #murray

26291	UNKNOWN	Murray going for more swear words than south park the movie! C'mon Andy you can turn this around! #usopen #passion
26292	UNKNOWN	Dear Twitterverse, may I please have a gif of Murray's F-bombs into the ESPN camera? I need it for future Mondays. Pls and thanks.
26293	UNKNOWN	@UltimateTennis_ he better close it in 3, not making much 1st serves and Murray seems winning all 2nd serves..important serve game to start?
26294	UNKNOWN	Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
26295	UNKNOWN	Anderson survives a test, and now has 2 sets up on Murray. Can the Brit pull off a 2nd 0-2 set comeback?
26296	UNKNOWN	Murray on the verge of being Scottish again for the 2nd time in a week.......

26300	UNKNOWN	Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated

26306	UNKNOWN	Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
26307	UNKNOWN	Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
26308	UNKNOWN	Tomorrow is going to be my tenth time seeing Shawn perform, I'm so lucky to be able to even once, this is so insane
26309	UNKNOWN	Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead

26323	UNKNOWN	Murray breaks again!! Back to back breaks in the 3rd set, Game face on!
26324	UNKNOWN	Anderson is up 2 sets, but Murray is up a break in the 3rd set. It feels even-steven right now.
26325	UNKNOWN	@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)
26326	UNKNOWN	ESPN announces "We're going to be here for awhile tonight" -- Murray looks to run away with the 3rd set. up 3-1, with the serve.
26327	UNKNOWN	Murray is pissed here and in the march! Hope he pulls it off #USOpen
26328	UNKNOWN	Although it's hard to tell, since I only have radio commentary. May just be that Anderson is choking badly, not Murray playing better.
26329	UNKNOWN	Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen
26330	UNKNOWN	@CelebInfoForYou would you be able to help me meet Cam or Shawn in NYC on Wednesday please

26338	UNKNOWN	@MillieMN001 Djokovic has worse antics than Murray in my opinion. But he's my 2nd fav player, after King Roger.
26339	UNKNOWN	@BehanCFC remember when you said gasquet will be out before Monday? m8 Murray is getting knocked out before him.
26340	UNKNOWN	listening to the weeknd on the radio and telling mom I want to see in December and she says "this is the Zayn guy right?"
26341	UNKNOWN	15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.
26342	UNKNOWN	@SamuraiErika it'll be all good when I see who the killer or killers are in Until Dawn. Still may get PS4 in Nov for Fallout 4. Want so bad

26397	UNKNOWN	It may only be the round of 16, but holy cow! Don't tell that Anderson and Murray! Incredible match! 3hrs and 40min so far. #USOpen2015
26398	UNKNOWN	Murray saves 2 break points and manages to hold serve to level the 4th set at 2-2. Murray not going down without a fight #USOpen
26399	UNKNOWN	3 hours 40 min on the clock now for Murray, but he's still hanging in there - grimly - &amp; has levelled at 2-2 4th set after winning 3rd on TB
26400	UNKNOWN	Ryan Braun is batting .284 with 25 home runs and 81 rbis.  But his team is in 4th. He will never be better than Curtis Granderson.

27464	UNKNOWN	Lol, get a grip #royals fans. I can forgive the HRs, but he biffed that pitch to Thor and then fell apart in the 4th https://t.co/5vyHq69IQn
27465	UNKNOWN	Thor is cruising and we are hosed...see you all tomorrow at 2-1
27466	UNKNOWN	Grandy showing some real nixe range our there in RF, saving a 2-out double to end the top 5th. 12 straight retired by Thor. #NYMvsKC
27467	UNKNOWN	@ACMI 2nd visit to David Bowie Is last night and I already feel like I should be going again! Absolutely amazing exhibition! Thank you! &lt;3
27468	UNKNOWN	Yes, Thor, I remember those 6th inning stats of yours. Let's lose them tonight, hey? #LGM
27469	UNKNOWN	Away. Away. Away. Syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside. Thor has found his groove. 5K. Top 6th.
27470	UNKNOWN	I have an uneasy feeling..last 2 times I felt this way was day before the attitude article &amp; when Briana came to London..I may be wrong tho
27471	UNKNOWN	Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets
27472	UNKNOWN	Hate to admit it but Arod is good in the booth. Interrupted Harold talking about Thor costumes for the 8th time and provides real insight
27473	UNKNOWN	@hughcartoons he was like David Abbott's edgier younger brother.  the Elvis Costello to David Abbott's George Harrison, if i may.
27474	UNKNOWN	Thor just giving me my 16th heart attack of the night. It's okay, just some candy corn lodged in my valves this time. #LGM
27475	UNKNOWN	Rios grounds out to end the inning. Should be all for Thor with Colon and Neise on bullpen. Still 5-3 Mets in 6th.
27476	UNKNOWN	Finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see Thor Finish up the 6th
27477	UNKNOWN	Thor said Thursday during press conf that he had tricks up his sleeve for tonight. It was the Warthen slider, he relied on it heavily 3 IP+
27478	UNKNOWN	@MetsProspectHub there's no way Thor should start the 7th anyway
27479	UNKNOWN	Thursday is Thor's day and I'm sore from the thunder of stress that I'm under
27480	UNKNOWN	People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
27481	UNKNOWN	Harold Reynolds talking how the 1st pitch from Thor sent a message, sure if you forget the Royals he 6 hits in the first 2 innings
27482	UNKNOWN	Put it in the books! Big games for The Captain, Thor, and Granderson. Let's got Matz tomorrow! #LGM
27483	UNKNOWN	Nice win, Thor, Captain America, and the Falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow. #LetsGoMets
27484	UNKNOWN	The first one is always the hardest. Way to go Thor!! Looking to tie it up tomorrow night! #LGM #MetsTwitter https://t.co/LPnQoXri1a
27485	UNKNOWN	I knew Thor would get the job done. Matz on tomorrow, offense seems to be waking up, Let's Go Mets!!! #LGM
27486	UNKNOWN	Here we go boys!!! Great job by Thor tonight!!!! And the Captain!! Huge spot for the Long Island kid Matz tomorrow.
27487	UNKNOWN	What's nice about CY pitching tomorrow night, he won't lose focus like Ventura did after Thor singled. We can't go to a game 7 with YV
27488	UNKNOWN	Win tomorrow and we get another shot at a 3 game set with Harvery deGrom and Thor #WontHappenAgain
27489	UNKNOWN	@cyr Me. I am a Caitlin face tonight, but a Thor face tomorrow.
27490	UNKNOWN	I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey.
27491	UNKNOWN	how about the balls on TC to stay with Thor with bases loaded to get that 3rd out!! #mets
27492	UNKNOWN	if YoVentura had done what @mets Thor did on the 1st pitch to Esky he would have been villainized. Instead, Thor is a hero. #GoRoyals
27493	UNKNOWN	@_mistermet @Buster_ESPN kinda hoping Matz pitches inside tomorrow, though he's a different pitcher than Thor
27494	UNKNOWN	I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.. Thor is a real life hero. #LGM
27495	UNKNOWN	Thor is the man, this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch
27496	UNKNOWN	I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
27497	UNKNOWN	@Lou_Pellegrino you must have heard thor's comments on the 1st pitch he's not afraid that much we know
27498	UNKNOWN	Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. I love it!!!!  https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
27499	UNKNOWN	I don't understand the narrative that Thor owned the game because of that first pitch. The Royals got to him in the 1st &amp;  2nd, right?
27500	UNKNOWN	Matz needs to come out firing  like Thor tomorrow  first pitch in the same place #Mets #MetsTwitter #MLB
27501	UNKNOWN	I don't know who but someone is partying with fat Thor tomorrow
27502	UNKNOWN	I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar. If I'm Matz, I'm doing the same thing Saturday.
27503	UNKNOWN	@TwinkleMets I just heard a quote that the Royals intend to get back at the Mets for the 1st pitch tonight Please tell Curtis to be careful!
27504	UNKNOWN	@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension. If KC throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob

27510	UNKNOWN	@PIITP A normal hard slide into 2nd would be comparison to Thor pitching inside,Utley comparison would be if he actually hit him in the head
27511	UNKNOWN	@brianbuck13 no more than when Curtis or Murphy had to dive in the 1st 2 games.
27512	UNKNOWN	@lindacohn @BMonzoWFAN Thor's single with 2 strikes leading off the 3rd is what should tick them off.

27993	UNKNOWN	@FNocher It was at Place de la Nation on the day of the mass march after Charlie Hebdo shooting. I probably should have noted that.

29176	UNKNOWN	Like I heard so many people complain about Kendrick's flow on TPAB but loved Black Friday. When he used the same EXACT flows in that.
29177	UNKNOWN	#Alert Rahul Gandhi will visit Flood Affected Chennai &amp; Cuddalore tomorrow and not the Court .. #ChennaiFloods
29178	UNKNOWN	Kendrick and Abel cleaning up Grammy nominations, new office with dope views, and new Latrell music on the way...big Monday
29179	UNKNOWN	He's still new to us. If Cole &amp; Kendrick just now getting the attention they deserve...c'mon now. These ppl clueless https://t.co/Gy1Yio44fL
29180	UNKNOWN	Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys.
29181	UNKNOWN	But ya...I'm just waiting for February so that Cole and Kendrick can drop their collabo album.
29182	UNKNOWN	This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him
29183	UNKNOWN	This day (26 Feb) in 1988 George Harrison received the award for "Video Of The Year" for "When We Was Fab".
29184	UNKNOWN	Can't wait for the picture of Kendrick holding 11 Grammys to surface so I can be like "this is for the people in March calling TPAB trash"
29185	UNKNOWN	Someone should suggest she READ some of Kendrick's LYRICS. It may be the 1st socially conscious experience she's EVER had #KathieLee
29186	UNKNOWN	Charlie Wilson, Kendrick Lamar, Charlie Puth. Glad I made plans with everyone who worked with them that I would see them in Feb. God blesses
29187	UNKNOWN	Kendrick always new content u don't know what to expect... Cole talk the same Shiit from 1st project on every one https://t.co/AgbUNmCxP6

29196	UNKNOWN	Someone said that they might snub Kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1. If that happens then it's clearly rigged.
29197	UNKNOWN	I may need to fact check, but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY.

29209	UNKNOWN	@LyleMSpencer In one respect, teams may value Zobrist more highly than Kendrick due to the draft pick compensation tied to Kendrick.
