Everyone should most definitely not go watch Star Wars on December 18th because it'll be a terrible movie
@WithYouRebelX I've had problems with my email and haven't received any information for Saturday's Star Wars secret cinema. Can you resend?
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!
@alexkidwell I give zero shits about Star Wars, and I'm only mildly excited by Bond films. Will I be seeing you on RHAP tomorrow?!
@BitterOldJoe it gave the impression the whole thing is a beery deconstruction of Star Wars for adult edgelords. I may read it anyway

It's already Friday. Not the TGIF kind of Friday... Can time freeze for a while?
And I don't know about TGIF. Fridays are terrible. I'm more of a TGIS person. Can it be Saturday already?
TGIF....oh wait, I have to babysit for 7 hours all day tomorrow....
Everyone's like TGIF!  And I'm over here like I work tonight. And a double tomorrow. And Sunday. And monday.  #grindin #needmoney
...and TGIF!!! What a week... I really dislike the 1st and the 3rd.
TGIF but even tho it's Friday I'm not happy
Yesterday was lastweek,and TGIF was two days ago,which was also last week, so how the hell is tomorrow monday?
this bitch said "TGIF" and it's Monday...
TGIF is totally meaningless when you have to work on Saturday..just sayin;)#PSYBringItOn
@thorharris666 or "happy Monday" or "TGIF" or... How about we all just shut the fuck up for a bit? The animals will appreciate it.
I prefer TGIS than TGIF now. Cause friday is always a stressful day
Tiger Woods won't win and thankfully this will be the last time we see him til October
Wow Tiger Woods is SHANKING his way through the 4th round!  Can't handle the pressure.
@GCTigerTracker - ONCE AGAIN TIGER WOODS SHITS THE DAMN BED ON A  SATURDAY, SUNDAY OR BOTH (which BOTH is what it is most of the time)
I was 2 optimistic yesterday when Tiger Woods was in 1st place..predicting he'd finish out of top 10. Should've been 20 #WyndhamChampionship
Tiger Woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. In contention and blows it on Sunday. Next step play 72 holes instead of 54.

@777Mediaprod Why is it because the flies are Tom Cruise from edge of tomorrow. Try to do something die, restart.
Why does Tom Cruise take 10,000 times to figure things out in the movie Edge Of Tomorrow, but gets it right 1st time in Mission Impossible?
I would have enjoyed Edge of Tomorrow more if Tom Cruise had to start each day by re-spawning in the bathroom of a Bubba Gump Shrimp.
finally watching edge of tomorrow nd surprise surprise, tom cruise is annoying in it
@gregthepaladin @padgettish @bootaide I mean it's 5th in a series, I don't expect perfection from that or Tom cruise just good action
@pecunium Edge of Tomorrow was Yet Another Tom Cruise Movie, which is to say it was too long, blew up too much shit, &amp; needed a better end.

@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree
@BaronGraham I understand why people may support them, but I totally despise UKIP. They're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that
@JamieRoss7 @mrjamesob I don't think she understood UKIP  at all. Suggest Nuttily Bennett may be more in step with her views
The same ppl who voted UKIP in May are only defending migrants coming to the UK because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer.
If there were an election tomorrow,UKIP still wouldnt get a great number of MP's,I hate to say it but I think this country is about finished
Deplorable and wrong-headed comments by Bristol's only UKIP councillor. I hope he loses his seat in May and UKIP fold http://t.co/l4k1GggRlm
@joerexrode Sorry, Joe, but the only way this team finishes 7th in the Big Ten would be major injuries to Valentine, Harris and Tum...
@steve196508 Evrn worse for people born around 14th November. Just the result of a Valentine's shag.
Remember when I bought cute ass lingerie for valentine's day &amp; my boyfriend sat me down &amp; watched Sin City instead of fucking my brains out?
Valentine's day may be rather depressing for me but I barely get to see this...
It was february 14 on Valentine's day, the roses came but they took you away, tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
I hope that guy goes all out for Valentine's Day. The fkn works. Then a few days before feb 14 he checks her phone, and sees a few messages
Valentine?!...it ain't even close to February yet...
One of the infinite reasons why valentine's day is the worst holiday in human existence https://t.co/rTXBO4Dj1x
They think cause they said some vague shit on that Friday in December that when Valentine's day comes around and they're with another girl
This was the last Sunday without #NFL #football until Valentine's day.
I think I posted surprise incest in the Golden Sun fanfic category once on Valentine's Day. I was a terrible person.
@ruraljules If it makes you feeling any better....I got dumped by my 1st boyfriend, by note, right before Valentine's Day. :\
I get way too hype about October fuck February Halloween is my Valentine's Day
Dumbass christian thought Valentine's Day was on the 13th... Bye
Ruble sliding again today, with dollar cracking above 64 rubles, for first time since Valentine's Day in February. http://t.co/sL7ZYvAGC5
But then i remembered she's the same hoe that never gave me a Valentine's Day card back in the 4th grade AND stole my scented eraser.
"The world will end on February 14 in the year 2016." "Valentine's Day. Bummer." http://t.co/vDMMKsq82d
900 Jews were burnt alive on 14 February 1349 in the "Valentine's Day" Strasbourg massacre, where the plague had not yet affected the city
@jnmccrmck It may as well be Halloween because people are just as fake on Valentine's Day. BOOM #GOTEEM
See this is my struggle. Don't  give me a Valentine's Day gift as a present, my birthday is the 16th not the 14th https://t.co/xlP7AYnfbQ
Why would you get married on Sept 11th?! If you want a 'special date', pick Valentine's Day like everyone else, leave that day alone.
Get me Valentine's Day hearts for Feb. 14 and I'm taking it as a sign you're breaking up with me. Love won't make you eat those things.
This is the last agonizing Sunday of the year. No more of these until Valentine's Day.

I wonder if my 3rd attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 will be the charm. I sure hope so it's taking several hours for each attempt.
so the Windows 10 upgrade may mean that various assistive technology softwares financed by DSA don't work? Awh what? http://t.co/0ZISCtaIxm
Photos may not come tonight. Updated to Windows 10, reset computer and now it doesn't remember which photos it has and is currently 1/2
Intended to finish my Windows 10 slides for the Aug @NelaInfoSec event.  Couldn't connect SP3 to internet; gave up.  Must complete tomorrow.
#money Windows 10's Real Cost Is To Pirated Software And Games: Microsoft may be about ... http://t.co/Y7sCmhgUwp http://t.co/HrdENZhbxe
Clearly you haven't upgraded to Windows 10 yet. Good night &amp; good luck! #Windows10Fail https://t.co/eGZ0BjVfgu
So apparently Sony VAIO laptops pre-installed with Windows 7 probably won't receive Windows 10 drivers until after November. #uninstallahoy
Fuck it, I think it may be time to give Windows 10 a try.  Once I finish this download, it's time to nuke this shit from orbit.
BEWARE - if you do not have to upgrade to Windows 10 you may want to think twice before you do. We would warn you... http://t.co/B1iSmtLihL
I'm in the process of updating to Windows 10. Close your home windows, wherever you are.....my screams may soon be deafening.
Upgrading to Windows 10 may be the worst computer-related decision I've made since deciding to play Neopets instead of going to class.
Windows 10 may be installed on 75 million PCs, but how many of those rolled back to their previous version, like me? Suck it, Microsoft.
1st blue screen of death in abt 7yrs and it happens aftr updating to Windows 10.Microsoft...*sigh* thought yall asses had it together by now
Grandma's hiring some dude to work on her computer tomorrow.....  A bit worried.. he might try to get her to install Windows 10.
Serato DJ isn't compatible with Windows 10 yet :( ...got to spin on my old laptop Saturday.
Just spent 5 hours babysitting my 5th attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 without success. Not sure what's wrong, but it's getting ridiculous.
anyone having problems with Windows 10? may be coincidental but since i downloaded, my WiFi keeps dropping out. Itunes had a malfunction
@AllAllen7 If the issue only occurs with Windows 10 and not your other PC or device. It sounds like the issue may be with Windows 10.
Upgrading to Windows 10. Might not be recording tonight after all. May need to cancel tomorrow night's stream to record Fable.
My AD/DA interface drivers just went BOOM!  It seems Microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to Windows 10. I may gone some time...
@squeejay this is on Windows 10, may have something to do with it; everything else is also slower than sh** through a funnel since 'upgrade'
Microsoft needs to get their shit together. Xbox live just went down for a 2nd day, what a fucking surprise @XboxSupport  #xboxlive
@XboxSupport abt time we got a reply from xbox 4 hours and counting, this is the 3rd time in a month what u doing to fix this issue xbox
So the Xbox live servers are down. No more Cod till Friday :(
@thepieface I hate it more. My Xbox controller is in London so I can't play until sunday
So, I have to wait until the 15th for The Taken King on Xbox? This some bullshit
@MrTLexify my Xbox box live expired last Friday the struggle are real
Just sitting here staring at my Xbox waiting for the #Destiny update to finish downloading. 30 + minutes. I may die waiting...
What will the Destiny 2.0 patch be at when I get home? 70% 48%? 95%? 2%? Who knows. My Xbox may just be on fire the way things were going.
@BungieHelp I've sat here since 7 its now 1am and it has moved 2% i'm off if it's not done when I wake I'll be ringing xbox for a refund.
no roommate, you may not get on Xbox live at midnight and talk deadass loud with ur online buddies when i have an 8 o'clock in the morning..
@KonamiSupport yo wtf why can't you fix the severs on Xbox one for fob it's September 9th and again can't get on
This may be our last chance to see Zlatan in the World Cup and FIFA totally fucked it up. Shocker.
Friend with connections just offered to let me meet Zlatan &amp; Co. in NJ tomorrow. Alas, my body sucks and I cannot.
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
@OccupyBears he fancied rolling the ball to Zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for PSG's 1st goal...
fucking cunt. I hope he eats Zlatan's shit in retirement league. https://t.co/blH85NzExz
@MinoRaiola just because your hunger for more money Zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap.
The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan)
Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!
