Sting will interfere and cost Undertaker the match this sunday . Or , it's possible we could see the return of the masked Kane . #SummerSlam
Sting defeat the @GoderichGrizz 9-4 ... On to fullarton tomorrow night to face the @FullartonAs
@JGoldLabel Doubt it . Rumor has it Kane may attack Lesnae because Lesnar " Put him out " Sting shows up sets up Taker vs Sting Mania 32
@TheDoctorIsntIn Interference seems a foregone conclusion to set up a 3rd match at WM ... unless Sting shows up tonight and screws Taker .
If Sting is on RAW tomorrow then there is no doubt he will confront The Undertaker to build towards a match at WrestleMania .
PWInsider reports that several sources indicate Sting flew back to New York City tonight , which could mean he appears at RAW tomorrow night .
@ShadouDoragon @HolyWhiteDragon @IronRockSaint -- instead responded to Sting's statement . " Hai , Sting-san ! May the guild with more --

@RossoneriBlog oh c'mon , you all know exactly what i meant . I never said Zlatan should be benched in 1st place . It's about possibilities .
@hello_noto01 Zlatan ! Cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to Ibrahimovic ... He's signing a new contract ! Zlatan to MUFC ?
#ManUnited #transfernews Ronaldo -Ramos - Zlatan - Muller . If you could pick one to sign tomorrow , who would it be ? http://t.co/SIPAgVJjLm
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago . I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it !
Further : Zlatan is the captain of the Mon-Stars . ( The plot involves him recruiting demons to take over world soccer ) .
@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors ? Cover if Zlatan leaves ? Or adding depth ? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality ?
Non issue " @itsKiragu : Man U playing against PSG on Thursday , niggahs will get thrashed like shit , Zlatan and Cavani gonna castrate you "
One word from Zlatan and he will keep quiet " @Crhedrys Lmaoooooo Hazard 3rd best ? Make Zlatan catch Mourinho fes . "
so is Zlatan gonna play the 2nd half for us or nah ?
replace Zlatan with Harry Kane on 8 Aug .. #Doomed https://t.co/jwZ5gSASRG
@mattoak I still say it's Monday after Zlatan finishes game on Sunday ... They're just prepping . They'll tease enough to gather the media .
Zlatan is a doubt for Friday's game at Lille with sprained ligaments in his knee . He had to be strapped up during the game last night . #PSG
@JenniferWegerup Hey Jennifer . What is your source for your article about Zlatan will be in Istanbul on the 6th of aug . Thanks a lot .
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight . May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class .
I don't want to wake up tomorrow , without Zlatan . #Galatasaray @Ibra_official
Ibra recovery time is still unknown , the French League starts on Friday . PSG will play Lille , Zlatan is very much in doubt for that .
@DivinityHope Sure , someone who scored more goals than Zlatan and Edinson would be 4th string lol you retard
@MilanEye I didn't buy your club to invest in Zlatan . I shall visit China tomorrow & gift you a china-made zlaCHAN 8 ) #Taekwondo #staycalm
@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st , it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear .
Zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with Caen ...
#BWFC Manager Neil Lennon has said Saturday's 0-0 with Derby , illustrates just why he's been chasing Zlatan & Neymar all summer long #SSNHQ
@nananavy That & Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs . Lyon . Why not just come off ? 2-0 up anyway .
@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan ? Is he fit to play this Sunday ?
@Paulkurth that 3rd shot looks like its from a Michael Bay movie . Zlatan just revealed himself to be Optimus prime .
Apparently Zlatan may leave PSG for United . He's already at a team that buys every high rate payer and wins fuck all , not sure why he'd go .
OH NO , we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available . Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen
Sun are so full of shit they say PSG trying to replace Zlatan with Neymar hahaha
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea . But not enough time rather try for Griezmann . Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either . Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore
@BumperGraham with mario rejoining Milan surely there's no room for 2nd reunion with Zlatan which therefore clears the path straight to utd
@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin . Obviously prefer Zlatan , muller , Lewandowski etc #mufc
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news
Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment , if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday , I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
If Wenger is in Paris . Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan ? Then again he may be on a family break .
Goal level : Zlatan 90k by Friday ? = Posting every other day #DSGS ( Vine by @ElexAuerbach ) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired . He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday . A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
Noooooo ! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday ! Oh well , still looking forward to the match . https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
@Fronsoir Zlatan has never done it on a wet Tuesday night at Stoke tbh
@ZIatanVines how many goals Zlatan intends to serve into the net on Friday . To know how to bet 1 & 3 + or 1 & 4+ ????
